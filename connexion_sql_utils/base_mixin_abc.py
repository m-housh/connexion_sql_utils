~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module contains an abc class that can be used to check that the
correct interface is defined to use the ``crud`` methods.  Nothing
actually inherits from this class as it breaks when making an
``sqlalchemy.ext.declarative:declarative_base``, but it is helpful
for ``issubclass`` and ``isinstance`` checks.


When inheriting from this package's :class:`BaseMixin` then one only
needs to implement a ``session_maker`` method.

    from this abc class because of inheritance conflicts with sqlalchemy's
    declarative base class, however if a mixin declares all the required
    methods, then it will pass an ``isinstance`` or an ``issubclass`` check.

    The mixin in this package declares all of the methods except the
    ``session_maker`` method which should be implemented once you create
    a ``sqlalchemy.orm.sessionmaker``

    Example::

        engine = create_engine(DB_URI)
